# US-Medical-Insurance
Project realized as a part of Data Science course on Codecademy

In my project, I want to consider the **dependence of the smoking on other factors, such as age, gender, the presence of children, region.** <br> Since a smoking can cause many diseases, insurance companies are interested in lowering it and making healthy their clients, reducing the risks of payments for the treatment of associated diseases. <br> After analyzing the data, we will try to answer the question of how an insurance company can improve the overweight situation.
